Katlego Vilakazi – IT System & Endpoint Administration Portfolio

👋 Introduction

Welcome to my professional IT portfolio! My name is Katlego (Kingsley) Vilakazi, and I am a Junior Systems Administrator specializing in Microsoft 365, Intune, and Windows endpoint management. This repository demonstrates my hands-on skills in endpoint administration, Group Policy, device compliance, and troubleshooting, aligned with the Microsoft MD-102: Endpoint Administrator certification.

I create and document real-world labs and projects that show practical problem-solving and IT management skills—skills I am actively applying in professional settings.
