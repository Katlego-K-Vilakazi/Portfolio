## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the configuration, setup, and management of users, groups, and NTFS permissions within a Windows Server environment. It includes creating organizational structures, assigning permissions, and validating access controls to ensure proper security and functionality.

## 🗂️ Project Objectives

* Create users and groups according to the project requirements.
* Assign NTFS permissions to shared folders.
* Ensure the correct users have the appropriate level of access.
* Validate that permission restrictions work as intended.

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed

* Configured user accounts and security groups.
* Applied NTFS permissions to Sales, Marketing, and other organizational folders.
* Ensured the **Boss** has the correct access permissions.
* Tested access with multiple accounts to confirm restrictions.

## ✅ Outcome

The project was successfully completed. All users and groups were configured correctly, permissions were applied as required, and the Boss was granted access to the Sales and Marketing folders.

## 🧠 Reflection

During this project, I gained hands-on experience with Windows Server NTFS permissions and user/group configuration. I learned how important it is to plan folder structures carefully and apply permissions using best practices like group-based access control. Testing each account helped me fully understand how effective permission setups can prevent unauthorized access while enabling seamless collaboration.
